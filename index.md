Bienvenue sur le blog de James Tan! On va discuter beaucoup de chose qui m'interressent, comme la technologie, les langues Ã©trangÃ¨res et aussi les autres chosesğŸ˜‰.

Did that catch you by surprise? My name is **James** and welcome to my blog! Like all other Malaysians, I pride myself to be a polyglot (one of who knows many languages). In descending order of fluency, I speak English ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§, Chinese ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³, French ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· and Malay ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¾. In this blog, I intend to 5share my ideas and experiences related to tech ğŸ’», both inside and outside of work. From time to time, I shall also share my language learning experiences!
