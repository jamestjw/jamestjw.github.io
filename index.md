Bienvenue sur le blog de James! Je vais vous parler des choses qui
m'intÃ©ressent, en ce moment il s'agit surtout des langues Ã©trangÃ¨res, des
Ã©checs et de la thÃ©orie des types.

Did that catch you by surprise? My name is **James** and welcome to my blog!
Like all other Malaysians, I pride myself on being a polyglot (one of who knows
many languages). In descending order of fluency, I speak English ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§, Chinese
ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³, French ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· and Malay ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¾. In this blog, I share my ideas and
experiences related to tech ğŸ’» and some of my thoughts on what's going on in my
life. From time to time, I shall also share my language learning experiences! I
am an aficionado of chess, I intend to share to more of my chess related
experiences here. Academically, my interests lie in type theory.
