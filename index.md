Bienvenue sur le blog de James! Je vous parlerai des choses qui m'intÃ©ressent,
en ce moment il s'agit surtout des langues Ã©trangÃ¨res, des Ã©checs et de la
thÃ©orie des types.

Did that catch you by surprise? My name is **James** and welcome to my blog!
Like all other Malaysians, I pride myself on being a polyglot (one of who knows
many languages). In descending order of fluency, I speak English ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§, Chinese
ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³, French ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· and Malay ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¾. In this blog, I share my ideas and experiences
related to tech ğŸ’» and some of my thoughts on what's going on in my life. From
time to time, I shall also share my language learning experiences! I am an
aficionado of chess, I intend to share to more of my chess related experiences
here. Academically, my interests lie in type theory. Naturally, I'm a big fan of
functional programming. Oh and when I write in English, I insist on spelling
things the British way.
