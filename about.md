# About

Hello there and welcome to my blog! My name is James and I am 26 years old this year (2023) 😄. I worked previously as a Software Engineer 👨🏻‍💻. My recent interests include programming languages, type theory, foreign languages and chess. I plan to share my ideas and thoughts on these subjects more frequently throughout the span of the next year in this blog!

Connect and network with me in various platforms **below** 😉. Feel free to strike up a conversation with me on just about any topic.
