# About

Hello there and welcome to my blog! My name is James, I am 27 years old this
year (2024) 😄 and I'm based in Montréal, Québec. I worked previously as a
Software Developer👨🏻‍💻. My recent interests include programming
languages, type theory, foreign languages and chess. I plan to share my ideas
and thoughts on these subjects more frequently throughout the span of the next
year in this blog!

I graduated from l'Université de Montréal in August 2024, and will be returning
to the industry to work as a Software Developer. I'm also a huge fan of
functional programming languages, my favourite one being OCaml at the moment.

strike up a conversation with me on just about any topic.
