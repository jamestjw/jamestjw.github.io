# About

Hello there and welcome to my blog! My name is James and I am 24 years old this year (2021) 😄. I am currently working as a Software Engineer 👨🏻‍💻. My recent interests include operating systems, compilers and chess. I plan to share my ideas and thoughts on these subjects more frequently throughout the span of the next year in this blog!

Connect and network with me in various platforms **below** 😉. Feel free to strike up a conversation with me on just about any topic.
